to do list:
- vsc attach to container
    - done
- Try Jupyter notebook in a Container.
    - done
- start coding 
- docker volume vsc internal config file

    - 先不要管container內容使用者
    - 目前已可保留extension在volume中
    - 下個目標：預先宣告volume，再連結
    - When using \ to split lines, don't put anything after \, or would be interpreted as other things.
